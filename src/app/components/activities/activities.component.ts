      the MahurGad fort. Although the fort is now destroyed and only the gates
      are remaining, this trek is overwhelmingly beautiful with all the
      surrounding valleys and villages. But sometimes, the beauty of this trail
      gets faded from the litter and garbage spread across it by locals and
      tourists. On Jan 25th, 2020, NSS IIT Jammu undertook the responsibility to
      clean this beautiful trek and restore its natural beauty to make it more
      appealing to tourists. Around 20 students and some faculty members led
      by Dr Suchismita Roy, Dr. Sayantan Mandal and Dr Shantanu Madge
      covered the entire trek in around 8 hours and also picked the litter spread
      around. Encouraged by the students, some locals and tourists also helped
      to pick up the trash. Jay Narayan and Zaheer Abbas of final year took the
      responsibility of logistic arrangement and cleaning the track.`
