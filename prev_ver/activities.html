                                KRITASH, the social welfare club of IIT Jammu organised a workshop on
                                fire safety and First Aid to promote the importance of disaster
                                management. The workshop was addressed by Mr Sajjan Kumar, ex-fire
                                chief, municipal corporation, New Delhi. He informed the students about
                                fire safety, how to rescue and the do's and don'ts. Along with the lecture,
                                Mr Sajjan also demonstrated how to rescue people trapped in a fire as well
                                as how to use fire extinguishers.

                                Tanda and Jari are among the poorer villages that fall under the Jammu
                                district. The village population mostly consists of Scheduled Castes and
                                Scheduled Tribes. Most of the villagers are engaged in agriculture activities
                                or labourer work. So, NSS IIT Jammu undertook the task of understanding
                                the means of income and the living conditions of the villagers. Around 12
                                students along with NSS faculty coordinator and UBA Staff went around
                                the village interacting with the villagers and knowing about their living
                                conditions and understanding the problems faced by them ranging from a
                                shortage of water and electricity to shortage of farming area. This survey
                                provided the students with an insight into the problems faced and to help
                                them develop innovative means to cope up with these shortages.

                                The birthday of Mahatma Gandhi, father of the nation, not only enlightened
                                the countrymen about the integrity and solidarity of all the people living in
                                the country but also about the importance of cleanliness. Mahatma Gandhi,
                                lovingly known as Bapu, always educated people about keeping their
                                surroundings clean. Following the footsteps of the great leader, students at
                                IIT Jammu took part in a cleanliness campaign called Swachhta Abhiyan
                                where around fifty students along with the faculty coordinator and Social
                                welfare staff cleaned the crowded and littered Jammu bus stand and
                                railway station. It was a full day exercise by the students, and it helped
                                encourage the nearby people about the importance of cleanliness, and
                                many passengers complimented the students on their effort. NSS IIT
                                Jammu always informs people about the importance of cleanliness and
                                regularly works toward the same.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The department of electrical engineering organised a two-day workshop
                                on "HAM Radio" in collaboration with NSS IIT Jammu. The workshop was
                                addressed by Mr V. K. Arya, Debashish Das, and Mr VikasVerma, all of them
                                being highly renowned and well-known faces in the HAM world The
                                workshop saw enthusiastic participation, not only from the students and
                                faculty members of IIT Jammu but also from some nearby technical
                                colleges. HAM radio, also known as amateur radio, can be used for
                                communication across short and long distances without internet and cell
                                phone network. They are generally used as a hobby but can also be used
                                for communication during a disaster situation when other means of
                                communication are disrupted. This workshop aimed to teach students how
                                to operate a HAM radio and also to provide knowledge behind its
                                development and communication system.</p>

          <h4>Mansar Lake to MahurGarh Trek</h4>
          <p>It is an 8 km long hiking path from Mansar lake deer park to the ruins of
            the MahurGad fort. Although the fort is now destroyed and only the gates
            are remaining, this trek is overwhelmingly beautiful with all the
            surrounding valleys and villages. But sometimes, the beauty of this trail
            gets faded from the litter and garbage spread across it by locals and
            tourists. On Jan 25th, 2020, NSS IIT Jammu undertook the responsibility to
            clean this beautiful trek and restore its natural beauty to make it more
            appealing to tourists. Around 20 students and some faculty members led
            by Dr Suchismita Roy, Dr. Sayantan Mandal and Dr Shantanu Madge
            covered the entire trek in around 8 hours and also picked the litter spread
            around. Encouraged by the students, some locals and tourists also helped
            to pick up the trash. Jay Narayan and Zaheer Abbas of final year took the
            responsibility of logistic arrangement and cleaning the track.</p>

          <p>Student Council, IIT Jammu with NSS and Kritash(Social Welfare body) has
            taken the initiative of feeding the laborers who are unable to make the
            arrangements amid the lockdown. The fund is being arranged from
            students by donating the Mess refund days and an equal amount of food is
            being given to the laborers.
            The General Secretary along with other NSS students staying on campus
            are coordinating the arrangements. Along with the food, NSS students are
            spreading awareness regarding the precautions to be taken to fight COVID-
